# # INTRODUCTION
# 
# ### To know which factor may affect the student's performance, we classify the score into couple of ranks, and figure out which feature affects the score more significant. The independent variables are follow:
# 
# ### gender                                  : sex of students
# ### race/ethnicity                       : ethnicity of students
# ### parental level of education : parents' final education level
# ### lunch                                     : get their lunch before the exam
# ### test preparation course      : complete or not complete before test
